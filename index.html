	<h4><u>P</u>ushing dynamic and ubiquitous interaction between services <u>L</u>everaged in the Future Internet by <u>A</u>ppl<u>Y</u>ing complex event processing</h4>
	
 <p>PLAY will revolutionize the way People, Things and Services will cooperate and coexist in the Future Internet, by introducing ubiquity in the communication and proactivity in handling large scale distributed environments. PLAY is an open-source platform resulting from an <a href="play-projet.eu">European research project</a> and provided by <a href="http://www.ow2.org">OW2 Middleware Consortium</a>.</p>

<p>The main goal of PLAY is to develop and validate an elastic and reliable architecture for dynamic and complex, event-driven interaction in large highly distributed and heterogeneous service systems. Such an architecture will enable ubiquitous exchange of information between heterogeneous services, providing the possibilities to adapt and personalize their execution, resulting in the so-called situational-driven adaptivity.</p>

<div class="well">
<p>The main outcome will be a FOT (federated – open – trusted) Platform for event-driven interaction between services, that scales at the Internet level based on the proposed architecture and that addresses Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. The platform consists of:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Federated middleware layer</strong>: a peer-to-peer overlay network combined with a publish/subscribe mechanism, that has the task to collect events coming from the heterogeneous and distributed services,</li>
		<li><strong>Distributed complex event processor</strong>: an elastic, distributed computing cloud based engine for complex processing/combining of events coming from different services in order to detect interesting situations a service should react on</li>
		<li><strong>Situational-aware business adapter</strong>: a recommender engine for proposing adaptation and changes in running business processes and services in a non-predefined (ad-hoc) way, by ensuring the consistency of the whole instance.</li></p>
		
<p>The system is tested in two use cases: crisis management and telecom industry, showing the advantages of such an architecture for Future Internet. Indeed, PLAY aims to revolutionize the Future Internet by making it situational-aware, which leads to the event-aware services that are able to proactively adapt themselves to the changes in the environment.</p>
