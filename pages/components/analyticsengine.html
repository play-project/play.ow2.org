<p>DCEP is the complex event processor in PLAY. Our approach is based on declarative (logic) rules. We will bring this approach to the cloud creating a large-scale, elastic CEP service which dynamically adapts to fluctuating event frequencies.</p>

<p>DCEP is a native RDF event processor, which means RDF can be used directly for events and there is no need to model mappings to binary formats.</p>
